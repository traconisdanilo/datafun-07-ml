# datafun-03-analytics

> Professional Python project: working with data files for analytics.

## Project Planning

This project illustrates ETL data pipelines processing raw data with the following types:

- CSV (comma separated values)
- JSON (structured data commonly used to exchange information over the web)
- Text (excerpt from _Romeo and Juliet_)
- Excel file (using the `openpyxl` package added to `pyproject.toml`)

The working example illustrates a complete pipeline.
Use the working example and your resources to create your own processing pipelines.

Think about some raw data you would like to process.

- What format is the data? Choose from csv, json, text, or xlsx.
- Choose static data (e.g., in files), rather than data in motion (e.g., social media streams)
- Being able to read and process a wide variety of data files is critical in professional analytics.
- Python is popular partly because it makes building data pipelines relatively easy.

## Project Specific Choices for Data Pipeline projects

We've turned off some PyRight type checks since we are working with raw data pipelines.
- WHY: We don't know what types things are until after we read them.
- See pyproject.toml and the [tool.pyright] section for details.

We use keyword-only function arguments when defining our ETL functions.
- In our functions, you'll see a `*,`.
- The asterisk can appear anywhere in the list of parameters.
- EVERY argument AFTER the asterisk must be passed using the named keyword argument (also called kwarg), rather than by position.
- WHY: Requiring named arguments prevents argument-order mistakes.
- It also makes our function calls self-documenting, which can be especially helpful in data-processing pipelines.

## Large Project File

This repo includes a 2.2 MB Excel data file.
We have increased the size of the "large file" check in our pre-commit hooks.

## Three Workflows

There are three workflows for analytics projects.

- 01: Set Up Machine (Once Per Machine)
- 02: Set Up Project (Once Per Project)
- 03: Daily Workflow (Working With Python Project Code)

## 01: Set Up Machine (Once Per Machine)

Follow the detailed instructions at:
[**01. Set Up Your Machine**](https://denisecase.github.io/pro-analytics-02/01-set-up-machine/)

🛑 All steps must be completed and verified successfully.

## 02: Set Up Project (Once Per Project)

1. Get Repository: Sign in to GitHub, open this repository in your browser, and click **Copy this template** to get a copy in **YOURACCOUNT**.

2. Configure Repository Settings:
   - Select your repository **Settings** (the gear icon way on the right).
   -  Go to **Pages** tab / Enable GitHub Pages / Build and deployment / set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**
   -  Go to **Advanced Security** tab / Dependabot / **Dependabot security updates** / **Enable**
   -  Go to **Advanced Security** tab / Dependabot / **Grouped security updates** / **Enable**

3. Clone to local: Open a **machine terminal** in your **`Repos`** folder and clone your new repo.

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/YOURACCOUNT/datafun-03-analytics
  ```

4. Open project in VS Code: Change directory into the repo and open the project in VS Code by running `code .` ("code dot"):

  ```shell
  cd datafun-03-analytics
  code .
  ```

5. Install recommended extensions.

   - When VS Code opens, accept the Extension Recommendations (click **`Install All`** or similar when asked).

6. Set up a project Python environment (managed by `uv`) and align VS Code with it.

   - Use VS Code menu option `Terminal` / `New Terminal` to open a **VS Code terminal** in the root project folder.
   - Run the following commands, one at a time, hitting ENTER after each:

    ```shell
    uv self update
    uv python pin 3.14
    uv sync --extra dev --extra docs --upgrade
    ```

If asked: "We noticed a new environment has been created. Do you want to select it for the workspace folder?" Click **"Yes"**.

If successful, you'll see a new `.venv` folder appear in the root project folder.

Optional (recommended): install and run pre-commit checks:

```shell
uvx pre-commit install
git add -A
uvx pre-commit run --all-files
```

Fore more detailed instructions and troubleshooting, see the pro guide at:
[**02. Set Up Your Project**](https://denisecase.github.io/pro-analytics-02/02-set-up-project/)

🛑 Do not continue until all REQUIRED steps are complete and verified.

## 03: Daily Workflow (Working With Python Project Code)

Follow the detailed instructions at:
[**03. Daily Workflow**](https://denisecase.github.io/pro-analytics-02/03-daily-workflow/)

Commands are provided below to:

1. Git pull
2. Run and check the Python files
3. Build and serve docs
4. Save progress with Git add-commit-push
5. Update project files

VS Code should have only this project (datafun-03-analytics) open.
Use VS Code menu option `Terminal` / `New Terminal` and run the following commands:

```shell
git pull
```

In the same VS Code terminal, run any Python source files:

```shell
uv run python src/datafun_03_analytics/app_danilotraconis.py
uv run python src/datafun_03_analytics/app_danilotraconis.py
```

OR: Run them as modules (preferred):

```shell
uv run python -m datafun_03_analytics.app_danilotraconis
uv run python -m datafun_03_analytics.app_danilotraconis
```

For more see: [Running Python Reliably](https://denisecase.github.io/pro-analytics-02/06-python/running-python/).

If a command fails, verify:

- Only this project is open in VS Code.
- The terminal is open in the project root folder.
- The `uv sync --extra dev --extra docs --upgrade` command completed successfully.

Hint: if you run `ls` in the terminal, you should see files including `pyproject.toml`, `README.md`, and `uv.lock`.

Run Python checks and tests (as available):

```shell
uv run ruff format .
uv run ruff check . --fix
uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing
```

Build and serve docs (hit **CTRL+c** in the VS Code terminal to quit serving):

```shell
uv run mkdocs build --strict
uv run mkdocs serve
```

While editing project code and docs, repeat the commands above to run files, check them, and rebuild docs as needed.

Save progress frequently (some tools may make changes; you may need to **re-run git `add` and `commit`** to ensure everything gets committed before pushing):

```shell
git add -A
git commit -m "update"
git push -u origin main
```

Additional details and troubleshooting are available in the [Pro-Analytics-02 Documentation](https://denisecase.github.io/pro-analytics-02/).

## Project Objectives

### Project Task 1. Personalize Your Documentation Links

Open [mkdocs.yaml](./mkdocs.yaml).
This file configures the associated project documentation website (powered by MkDocs)
Use CTRL+f to find each occurrence of the source GitHub account (e.g. `danilotraconis`).
Change each occurrence to point to your GitHub account instead (spacing and capitalization MUST match the URL of your GitHub account **exactly**.)

### Project Task 2. Personalize Your Python File

1. Rename `app_danilotraconis.py` to reflect your name or alias.

- Find the file the file in the VS Code Explorer window (top icon on the left).
- Right-click / Rename.
- Follow conventions: name Python files in lower_snake_case, words joined with underscores, and using `.py` extension.

2. Edit this README.md file to change the run command to call your file instead.
   Use CTRL+f to search for `app_danilotraconis.py` and replace all occurrences exactly.
3. Preview this README.md to make sure it still appears correctly.
   - Find README.md in the VS Code Explorer window (top icon on the left)
   - Right-click / Preview
   - Fix any issues.
4. Run the updated command to execute **your** Python script.

### Project Task 3. Implement Your Python File


**Save often**: After making any useful progress, follow the steps to git add-commit-push.

## Notes

- You do not need to add to or modify `tests/`. They are provided for example only.
- You do not need to view or modify any of the supporting **config files**.
- Many of the repo files are silent helpers. Explore as you like, but nothing is required.
- You do NOT need to understand everything. Understanding builds naturally over time.
- Use the **UP ARROW** and **DOWN ARROW** in the terminal to scroll through past commands.
- Use `CTRL+f` to find (and replace) with in a file.

## Troubleshooting >>> or ...

If you see something like this in your terminal: `>>>` or `...`
You accidentally started Python interactive mode.
It happens.
Press `Ctrl+c` (both keys together) or `Ctrl+Z` then `Enter` on Windows.
